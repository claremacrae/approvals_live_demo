# 06 QImage

## Images

* Run the Images test
    * Note how Araxis Merge says the approved image is corrupt
* Run again with BeyondCompare
    * Note how the "approved" image is 1 byte
* Number of output files 
    * Note how all each output file overwrites previous one
    * Would be nice to include the colour in the filename
* Add a SECTION() to get separate output files
* Run again
    * Review the names of output files
* It's not convenient to approve image outputs
    * Could auto-approve
    * Or let the Diff tool do it
