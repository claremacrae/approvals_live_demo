# 5 QtWidgets

## Table

* This uses early version of ApprovalTests for Qt
* Run the table demo
    * Review the output
    * Mainly test behaviour of GUI code, not appearance
    * Review the implementation of verifyQTableView
        * Custom writer class
    * Once I've got code covered, would separate calculation code from drawing code

## Images

* Run the Images demo
* It's not convenient to approve image outputs
* Approvals doesn't know how to create an empty .png
    * Initial image is corrupt
* How to approve multiple images
