## Steps

* Set the file extension
    * Want approved files to have natural file extension
    * Options have a fluent interface - chain steps together
* Try BeyondCompare reporter
* Recommend creating `verifyYourThing()` to encapsulate and re-use tests
* And add `const Options& options = Options()` argument to your verify functions

## Time passes - maintenance done

* Does the change matter?
* Can create derived copies of your file
* For better visualisation
* Don't need to version-control the extra copies
