## Table

* This uses early version of ApprovalTests for Qt
* Run the table demo
    * Review the output
    * Mainly test behaviour of GUI code, not appearance
    * Review the implementation of verifyQTableView
        * Custom writer class
    * Once I've got code covered, would separate calculation code from drawing code
